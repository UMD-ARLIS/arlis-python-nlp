# arlis-python-nlp
Natural Language Processing Libraries for Text Extraction and Indexing specifically designed for the articles in the [Artificial Intelligence Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) (AIID)

## Introduction
This GitHub repository is for those who are involved in filling out the requried [taxonomy fields](https://incidentdatabase.ai/taxonomy/cset) for the articles in AIID. Many of the taxonomy fields as of writing this documentation have been filled manually, our program focuses on automating this process. The taxonomy fields that our program automates is Full description of the incident, Sector of deployment, Location, and Named Entities. If our work continues in the future, we will focus on trying to automate even more taxonomy fields. The way our program works is that you would import our libraries and use our functions to get these taxonomy fields. 

## Usage 
Instructions on how to use this program as well as the code itself is shown through a python notebook called [ReadMe.ipynb](https://github.com/UMD-ARLIS/arlis-python-nlp/blob/main/ReadMe.ipynb). This python notebook provides information on the purpose of this program as well as explaining the different parts of the code. For example the notebook explains what packages you have to import, how to add a website link to the code, and how to use its functions. This repository also contains a python file that has the same code that is in this notebook expect it is in .py format. However this file does not include the explanations that are in the notebook. This file is called [example.py](https://github.com/UMD-ARLIS/arlis-python-nlp/blob/main/example.py).
