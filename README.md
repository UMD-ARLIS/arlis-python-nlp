Natural Language Processing Libraries for Text Extraction and Indexing specifically designed for the articles in the [Artificial Intelligence Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) (AIID)

## Introduction
This GitHub repository is for those who are involved in filling out the requried [taxonomy fields](https://incidentdatabase.ai/taxonomy/cset) for the articles in AIID. Many of the taxonomy fields as of writing this documentation have been filled manually, our program focuses on automating this process. The taxonomy fields that our program automates is Full description of the incident, Sector of deployment, Location, and Named Entities. If our work continues in the future, we will focus on trying to automate even more taxonomy fields. The way our program works is that you would import our libraries and use our functions to get these taxonomy fields. This is will be further explained in the following section.

## Usage -> go to example.py
or we can put it here with sample output
